The dates are 1 day behind, so for your daily answer you will have to go ahead by 1 day.
So say the date is 2/27/22 and the answer for today that you put in is incorrect, you will have to use the answer for the 28th of Febuary. Meaning that the answer for the 28th will be the answer that is for the 29th.

Computers start counting from 0, so thats why.
